# Project Name

**Author**: Joshua Huston
**Version**: 1.3.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Created a React application that takes in a string to search a city name with a location API. Returns the latitude and longitude, and uses those coordinates to display a map image of the city.

## Getting Started

## Architecture

App is using React to create a Card to match up user inputted data to an API call. 

I used the Trello board provided to first create a functioning version of the App by just returning the data that I needed. In the latest version I created the components to render the map and error message.

## Change Log

### Map Feature:

10-07-21: App is pulling down data to display the map.
Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

Actual time needed to complete: 4 hours (Stuck on Map URL! Thanks to Fizzo for help solving)

### Location Feature:

10-06-21: App is getting the correct data from the API to display latitude and longitude data.
Estimate of time needed to complete: 1.5 hours

Actual time needed to complete: 1.5 hours

### Component Feature:

10-07-21: Pushed all data into components using state and props.
Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

Actual time needed to complete: 1 hour. Starting to finally internalize state and props to build components!

# Cache Feature:

10.20.21 - Set the cache to store memory locally
I thought this would take significantly longer than it did. Expectation was that it would take 2 hours and it took less than 1.
